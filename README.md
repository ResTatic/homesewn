A fully static Next.js Blog, with content from Sanity CMS.
Dynamically updated on content change via webhook and [on-demand revalidation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration#on-demand-revalidation-beta) (added and removed content still needs redeploys for now).

From the ground up, no extra dependencies, fully custom UI and styling, handcoded with ‚ù§.
